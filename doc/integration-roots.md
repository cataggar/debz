# Hermetic Debian-family integration roots

`zig build test-integration` builds a small deterministic repository, signs its
`InRelease` with the existing synthetic test-only OpenPGP key, and drives the
production CLI against disposable cache, state, and dpkg roots under
`.zig-cache/`. It never invokes apt against the host and never uses the host
dpkg database. Generated repositories are bounded to 8 MiB and contain no
network-derived input.

## Local prerequisites

- Zig 0.16.0 and liblzma development files;
- Python 3 with `cryptography`;
- `dpkg` only for the full install/configure/remove/recovery lane.

Run one profile:

```sh
DEBZ_INTEGRATION_SUITE=debian-stable \
DEBZ_INTEGRATION_ARCH=amd64 \
DEBZ_INTEGRATION_MODE=smoke \
zig build test-integration
```

Accepted suites are `debian-stable` and `ubuntu-26.04`; architectures are
`amd64` and `arm64`; modes are `smoke` and `full`. Full mode requires `dpkg`
and fails rather than skipping transaction assertions.
Refresh, planning, verified downloads, cache replay, payload validation, policy,
and reproducibility remain mandatory on every host. No qemu or foreign
executable is used. Foreign packages contain inert data only.

## Support claims

The suite names identify fixture contracts, not downloaded vendor root
filesystems. Their signed repository identities and suite-marker versions
differ, so Debian and Ubuntu rows cannot collapse to aliases. PR CI requires
all four suite/architecture combinations in full mode on native amd64 and arm64
runners, including mandatory dpkg-root transactions. Scheduled/manual CI adds
foreign arm64 roots on amd64.

The repository exercises dependencies and Pre-Depends, alternatives,
versioned virtual Provides, Conflicts/Breaks/Replaces, Recommends policy,
Essential and Protected metadata, Multi-Arch, cycles, conffiles, triggers, and
a deliberately failing maintainer script. Full mode also injects cache
corruption. Transaction interruption, lock loss/contention, exact lock
verification, held-package policy, timeout, recovery-state transitions, and
atomic provenance publication use the production executor/recovery seams and
their mandatory Zig tests; they do not require unsafe process killing in a
black-box shell test.

Repository generation is byte-reproducible: fixed archive metadata, package
ordering, signing key, signature time, Release timestamps, and compressed
members produce identical repository and provenance digests. The Release
validity window is fixed from 2024 through 2037. CI retains full-lane root,
cache, state, and provenance artifacts for seven days.

Optional real Debian/Ubuntu snapshot checks are intentionally separate from PR
CI: operators may point the public CLI at explicitly pinned HTTPS snapshots and
explicit vendor keyrings. Such a lane must cap download size and time and must
not replace the deterministic fixture gate. apt/dpkg may be used as a
black-box semantic oracle when developing fixtures, but its output is never
copied into production expectations.
